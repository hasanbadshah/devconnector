mern stack starter application

Developer's social network (medium level application)

In this application, we will be learning how express js routes work and basic node api concepts. This initial commit is not having
any frontend js framework example.

In future commits there will be react framework usage with this node api including jwt web tokens. login/sign up profile related info crud with mlab are
major learning points in this application using MERN js.
